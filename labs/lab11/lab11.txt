Compare and contrast your development and production deployments and explain how each is designed.
 	- The production code is meant to be optimized for performance. We want the stuff on the browser to be as fast
	as possible for the user. This means the javascript will be uglier and take up less space. Its also used by the
	webpack.production.config.js file.
	- The development deployment is used for developing. We add new features on this branch to test and debug before
	putting them onto the production branch. 


List the optimizations youâ€™ve configured for this production version and, if possible, find evidence of then in the
deployed application files.

	- Two big things changed are UglifyJS and OptomizeOccuranceOrderPlugin. The uglify compresses the code to take 
	up less space and perform better. The optimzeOccurenceOrderPlugin makes the bundle file smaller. 
	
	
What advantage is there is deploying an application to a PaaS tool like Heroku?
	- Working on Heroku lets you keep a live running version of you site up. This lets you run it so that everyone
	can connect. In addition to this, you can update the feature/development branch whenever you like without messing
	up your site and then deploy to production when its ready. 
	
	
How does Heroku know how to install and run your application (after pulling it from the specified branch on GitHub)?
	- It enters the package.json file and uses the install and start script. From these it follows the commands to 
	install all the modules needed so they don't have to be uploaded. It also runs whatever server file you have 
	with the start command.
