What benefit did using the React Router bring to the application?
  - it allowed us to use browser history and becasue of that we can store data in the form of URLs. 



Which is better, hash history or browser history?
  - browser history stores state information which benefits the app. 
  
Why does the server (either Webpack Dev Server or the Express server) have to be modified to support the browser history? Compare this with the hash-based server demonstrated in class, which didn't require such modifications.
  - The default is for the browser to hash the form data. We have to keep it from hasing it so we can use the data.

How is the Link added in the last step different from a simple HTML hyperlink?
